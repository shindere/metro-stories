This repository provides a small web-site that lets one find metro
entrances/exits around a given address in France.

To find its results, the application first looks up the french national
address database to associate a GPS location to the specified address.

It then looks up OpenStreetMap to find the subway entrances/exits
nearest to this location.

The web site is available at the following address:
